# Deer-Renderer
### A simple 3D OpenGL rendering demo

---

[Download Demo](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Deer-Renderer/releases/download/1.0.0/DeerRenderer.zip) (DeerRenderer.zip) * Note that this demo requires Windows to run.

This demo was built using MinGW64 for a Windows machine.

This project utilizes the graphics card for hardware-accelerated rendering. Using shaders (mini programs that run on the GPU), we have full control over the position and color of every pixel on the screen. With this, you can create fun imagery such as this.

This is one of my first projects with OpenGL and is by no means well designed. It does however, showcase what is required to start rendering models with the specification.
